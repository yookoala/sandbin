# Run it with podman

Build the image (hermetic two stages: `golang:1.26-alpine` builds, `alpine:3.22` runs; the
host needs nothing but podman). Build it under exactly this tag, because the quadlet unit
looks for it and podman tries to pull a registry image otherwise:

```sh
podman build -t localhost/sandbin:latest .
```

`make container` runs that same build through podman with the version string from
`scripts/version.sh` passed in, which is what the container's `sandbin --version` then prints; to
do it by hand instead of through the Makefile:

```sh
podman build -t localhost/sandbin:latest --build-arg SANDBIN_VERSION="$(scripts/version.sh)" .
```

Without `--build-arg` the stamp is empty and the image falls back to what the copied tree can
honestly say: the tag `internal/version/release.txt` carries at a release, otherwise plain `dev`.

Podman warns `HEALTHCHECK is not supported for OCI image format` on every build: its default
image format drops that line. The probes below are the podman-native form, and podman runs
them. Add `--format docker` to the build instead if you want the image to carry it.

Ad-hoc run, with a named volume holding the sqlite file, the key from a `0600` env file, and
the health probe. It needs no command of its own: the image's CMD is `serve --db
/data/sandbin.db`.

```sh
podman run -d --name sandbin -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -v sandbin-data:/data \
  --env-file ~/.config/sandbin/sandbin.env \
  --health-cmd "wget -q -O /dev/null http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthz || exit 1" \
  --health-interval=30s --health-start-period=5s --health-retries=3 \
  localhost/sandbin:latest   # runs serve --db /data/sandbin.db
podman inspect --format '{{.State.Health.Status}}' sandbin   # probed every 30s, healthy on a healthy server
```

As a systemd user service through podman quadlet:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/containers/systemd ~/.config/sandbin
cp deploy/sandbin.container ~/.config/containers/systemd/
install -m 600 deploy/sandbin.env.example ~/.config/sandbin/sandbin.env   # then edit replace-me
sed -i "s#^EnvironmentFile=.*#EnvironmentFile=$HOME/.config/sandbin/sandbin.env#" ~/.config/containers/systemd/sandbin.container
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user start sandbin
```

The `sed` is not optional. `deploy/sandbin.container` points `EnvironmentFile=` at
`/etc/sandbin/sandbin.env`, meant for a system install, and quadlet resolves a relative or
`~`-prefixed path against the unit's own directory, so an unedited `~/.config/...` value
restart-loops. For a system install, keep the path as shipped and create `/etc/sandbin/sandbin.env`
with mode 0600 instead.

The published port is loopback-only (`PublishPort=127.0.0.1:8080:8080`) because this is a
preview tool; edit the unit to `8080:8080` to expose it on the network. The API key never
appears in the container command line, but it is visible in `podman inspect` output
(`Config.Env`), so treat the env file like a password.
